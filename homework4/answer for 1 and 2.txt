1. because the value of x11/x21 and x12/x22 are both zero, so both x1 and x2 for row 1 and 2
will be eliminated in the first round at the same time, thus when come to the second round,
the value of xn2/x22 will become n/0, which will make the function crush

2. similar problem as question 1: after swapping, for both row1 and row2, x1 and x2 share the
same coefficients, so the operation for eliminate the x1 will also eliminate the x2, which
make the function crush as the same reason as question 1

the solution of this problem is to change the inner-most layer of loop from loop from i to n+1 to n+1 to i
